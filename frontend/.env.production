# Production Environment Variables for Vercel

# Railway-Vercel integration will automatically provide:
# RAILWAY_STATIC_URL or similar variable with your backend URL
# Use this in your frontend code: import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_URL

# If using Railway integration, it might be provided as:
# VITE_BASE_URL=${RAILWAY_STATIC_URL} or similar

# Manual fallback (replace if integration doesn't work):
VITE_BASE_URL=https://your-railway-backend-url.up.railway.app
